?> Tome was built and tested using GameMaker LTS 2022, but it theory it should work on the newest monthly releases since Tome only uses native GM functions.

## How is Tome Useful?
Documenting code is incredibly important, especially when working in a team or writing code that you expect others to interact with. Writing proper documentation can often be a hassle, and not to mention keeping it up to date with changes to the code base. Tome seeks to remedy this issue by allowing you to automatically generate high quality documentation directly from your project with minimal setup!

## How Tome Works
Tome works by parsing jsdoc comments from scripts, notes, and external text files that are specified by the user. These files are converted into .md files, automatically committed to the specified GitHub repo and built into a site using [Docsify]()
