## Live Reloading
GitHub pages can take a few minutes to update your site most times. To see a preview of your site immediately, you can use Docsify's live reloading feature. The steps to setting that up are as follows.
1. Clone your site's repo locally using GitHub Desktop 
2. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 
3. Open command line and follow this [guide](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart)
    <br>**TLDR**
    1. Open the command prompt and type the following: `npm i docsify-cli -g` and press enter
    2. Use the `cd` command to point the command line to your repo's directory like: `cd c:/users/username/GitHub/repo`
    3. Use the command `docsify serve` to start your site running on a local server.
    4. Now, open your browser and type in the address bar: `http://localhost:3000`. Anytime your site is updated, the changes will instantly appear here as long as the command prompt is left open.

?> Don't forget to pull your changes from GitHub each time you run your project or the changes will not show up locally!
