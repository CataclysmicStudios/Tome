?> This guide assumes you know the basics of how Github repos work

The first thing you need to do is create a new repo to hold your docs, or create a new branch on an existing repo. Your repo must must have an active branch in order for Tome to function.

## Creating A Personal Access Token
Once your repo is setup and ready, next you'll need to create a GitHub token in order for Tome to push your documentation remotely.

1. On GitHub.com after logging in, click your avatar in the top right-hand corner of the page.

## Setting up GitHub Pages
Next we'll configure Github pages to automatically deploy your site. Unless you are using a custom domain, your site's domain will be `username.github.io/repoName`.

1. on GitHub.com, find your repo and click settings

4. After saving, and several minutes have passed, you should see at the top of the page that your site is live!

## Configuring Your Project
Now on to the GameMaker side of things 
1. Make sure Tome is imported into your project.
2. Open up the script **tomeConfig**. Here is a set of macros to config Tome.
3. Find the macro `TOME_GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN` and set it to the GitHub token you just copied in string form like: `"fhfhdhdj77"`
4. Set `TOME_GITHUB_USERNAME` to your username as a string like: `"chesrowe"`
5. Set `TOME_GITHUB_REPO_NAME` to the name of your repo
6. Set `TOME_GITHUB_REPO_BRANCH` to the name of the branch within your repo that you'll use for Tome. the default is `"main"`. Although you might want to make a `"docs"` branch on your main repo and use that.
7. If you want your docs to be stored inside a folder within your repo, you can use `TOME_GITHUB_REPO_DOC_DIRECTORY` to point Tome to that.

Tome is now setup and ready to use!
