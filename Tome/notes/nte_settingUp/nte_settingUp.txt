?> This guide assumes you know the basics of how Github repos work

## Setting up Tome in your project
1) Download the [latest version](https://github.com/chesrowe/Tome/releases) of Tome and import the `.yymps` file into your project.
2) Clone the Github repo you want to use for your site locally.
3) In your project, navigate to the script `tomeConfig` and set the macro `TOME_LOCAL_REPO_PATH` to the path of your locally cloned Github repo.

## Setting up GitHub Pages
Next we'll configure Github pages to automatically deploy your site. Unless you are using a custom domain, your site's domain will be `username.github.io/repoName`.

1. on [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com), find your repo and click **settings**

4. After saving, and several minutes have passed, you should see at the top of the page that your site is live!
