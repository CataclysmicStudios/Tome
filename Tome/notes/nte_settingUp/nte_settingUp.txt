?> This guide assumes you now the basics of how Github repos work

The first thing you need to do is create a new repo to hold your docs, or create a new branch on an existing repo.

## Creating A Personal Access Token
Once your repo is setup and ready, next you'll need to create a GitHub token in order for Tome to push your documentation remotely.

1. On GitHub.com after logging in, click your avatar in the top right-hand corner of the page.

## Setting up GitHub Pages
Next we'll configure Github pages to automatically deploy your site. Unless you are using a custom domain, your site's domain will be `username.github.io/repoName`.

1. on GitHub.com, find your repo and click settings

3. Make sure your source is set to deploy from branch, select the branch your docs are on, and then click save.

4. After saving, and several minutes have passed, you should see at the top of the page that your site is live!

## Configuring Your Project
Now on to the GameMaker side of things 
1. Make sure Tome is imported into your project.
2. Open up the script **tomeConfig**. Here is a set of macros to config Tome.
3. Find the macro `TOME_GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN` and set it to the GitHub token you just copied in string form like: `"fhfhdhdj77"`
4. Set `TOME_GITHUB_USERNAME` to your username as a string like: `"chesrowe"`
5. Set `TOME_GITHUB_REPO_NAME` to the name of your repo
6. Set `TOME_GITHUB_REPO_BRANCH` to the name of the branch within your repo that you'll use for Tome. the default is `"main"`. Although you might want to make a `"docs"` branch on your main repo and use that.
7. If you want your docs to be stored inside a folder within your repo, you can use `TOME_GITHUB_REPO_DOC_DIRECTORY` to point Tome to that.

Tome is now setup and ready to use!
